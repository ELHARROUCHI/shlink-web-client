<!--
Before opening an issue, just take into account that this is a completely free of charge open source project.
I'm always happy to help and provide support, but some understanding will be required.
I do this in my own free time, so expect some delays when implementing new features and fixing bugs, and don't take it personal if an issue gets eventually closed.
Try to be polite, and understand it is impossible for a project to cover all use cases.
